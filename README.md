## Description

Recipe Catalogue is a React & Redux web app based on a catalog of recipes. It contains a browsable list of meals that you can filter by category or type and access to one meal recipe. The data is retrieved from [Meals DB (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and then stored in the Redux store.
